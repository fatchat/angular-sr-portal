angular-sr-portal
=================

Generic Service Request portal using AngularJS

I wrote this for a client POC. It is a very small application, I wanted it on GitHub just to be able to refer to it if I need to. I'm not sure if it will be useful to anyone else, but go ahead and take a look if you like.

I have taken out the client's name as well as the name of the tools which I integrated with.
